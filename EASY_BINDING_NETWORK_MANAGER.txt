Installing on Linux Mint 18(Kernel 4.4.0-43-generic) for UsbStick Adapter TPLINK T2UH AC600

After some problems installing that module on Linux Mint 18 and search for solution and not found in any local one solution I have resolved my problem with simple steps because I have observed some details and differences with Ubuntu based version install.

I have decided share that for help any person searching for same solution and not found that.

After you install that module the same is not activated and not binded on NetworkManager and you have follow some steps for complete install and activate that module:

1) Edit file sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and change:
from: 
[ifupdown] 
managed=false

to: 
[ifupdown] 
managed=true

2) Create one script with any name that you like. I have create that on /usr/local/bin/netscript and put on that script:
#!/bin/sh 
modprobe mt7650u_sta 
ifconfig ra0 up 
service NetworkManager restart

3) Save script and change owner and permitions:
sudo chown root /usr/local/bin/netscript 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/netscript

4) The more easy step for activate module on starting graphics environment(runlevel 2) is create one cron script and put in /etc/cron.d and in any restart for Linux Mint that module is activated.
Post that I have created other script on /etc/cron.d/netscript and put that content on it:
SHELL=/bin/sh 
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

@reboot root netscript

5) Save script and change owner and permitions:
sudo chown root /etc/cron.d/netscript 
sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.d/netscript

6) Restart your Linux Mint and use your usbstick in full resources.
If you get more rapid use, only execute on term that command:
sudo netscript

After much time searching solutions that resolved my problem and finally using Linux Mint 18 with TPLINK T2UH AC600 with 100% bandwidth.
