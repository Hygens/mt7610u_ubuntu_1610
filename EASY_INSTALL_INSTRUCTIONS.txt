sudo apt-get install git build-essential
git clone https://github.com/Myria-de/mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916.git
cd mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916

The dongle should work. The only problem is that you will have to re-install it after each kernel upgrade.

But if you keep the driver folder mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916, then it will be quite easy.

You will need to run only

cd mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916
make
sudo make install
after a kernel upgrade.

It is also possible to install it using DKMS. In this case it will rebuild automatically on kernel upgrades.
